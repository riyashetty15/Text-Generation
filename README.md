# Text-Generation
Develop a project using Reddit API through which I would generate six-word and one-line stories using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model from Redditâ€™s r/SixWordStories and r/OneLiners subreddits. One has to find words that represented a story that is funny/sad/dark, while simultaneously constraining one scenario by word count and restricting the other by sentence length.
