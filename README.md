# Text-Generation
Develop a project using Reddit API through which I would generate six-word and one-line stories using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model from Redditâ€™s r/SixWordStories and r/OneLiners subreddits. One has to find words that represented a story that is funny/sad/dark, while simultaneously constraining one scenario by word count and restricting the other by sentence length.
Initially, when the code is run it would download the pretrained model which is nearly of 600 mb and is automatically saved into the aitxtgen folder. Hence, when you re-run the code it will just load in the downloaded model rather than downloading the whole model again!
